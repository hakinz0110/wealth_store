# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating both the Customer App and Admin App with Supabase backend services, including database management, authentication, real-time syncing, and cloud storage. The Admin App UI is already built but needs full functionality to manage products, categories, orders, banners, coupons, and file uploads. The integration must provide role-based access control ensuring only verified admin accounts can access admin functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Supabase Initialization and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both Flutter apps properly configured with Supabase, so that they can communicate with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the apps are initialized THEN both Customer and Admin apps SHALL have correct supabase_url and anon/public_key configured
2. WHEN Supabase is initialized THEN the Flutter SDK SHALL be properly set up according to official documentation
3. WHEN the configuration is complete THEN both apps SHALL successfully connect to the Supabase instance

### Requirement 2: Authentication System

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want secure login functionality with role-based access, so that only verified admins can access the admin dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate through Supabase Auth
2. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL verify their admin role from profiles/users tables
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL handle it through Supabase Auth
5. WHEN a non-admin user attempts admin access THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 3: Database Synchronization

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view and manage all eCommerce data from the admin dashboard, so that I can control the entire store operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from Products table
2. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from Categories table
3. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from Orders table
4. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from Banners table
5. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from Coupons table
6. WHEN admin modifies any data THEN changes SHALL be pushed to Supabase database
7. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates

### Requirement 4: Cloud Storage Integration

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage product images and files through the admin interface, so that I can maintain the store's visual content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin accesses file management THEN the system SHALL display already uploaded product images
2. WHEN admin uploads a new file THEN it SHALL be stored in Supabase Storage
3. WHEN admin removes a file THEN it SHALL be deleted from Supabase Storage
4. WHEN images are uploaded THEN their URLs SHALL be saved to appropriate product records
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Admin Dashboard CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As an admin, I want full create, read, update, and delete control over all store entities, so that I can manage the entire eCommerce operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses Product Page THEN they SHALL be able to create, read, update, and delete products
2. WHEN admin accesses Category Page THEN they SHALL be able to create, read, update, and delete categories
3. WHEN admin accesses Banner Page THEN they SHALL be able to create, read, update, and delete banners
4. WHEN admin accesses Coupon Page THEN they SHALL be able to create, read, update, and delete coupons
5. WHEN admin accesses Orders Page THEN they SHALL be able to view and update order statuses
6. WHEN admin accesses File Storage Page THEN they SHALL be able to upload, view, and delete files
7. WHEN admin accesses User Management THEN they SHALL be able to manage user roles and permissions

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and testing procedures, so that the application runs reliably without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task is completed THEN the system SHALL be tested with `flutter run -d chrome`
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN they SHALL be debugged and fixed before proceeding
3. WHEN operations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to users
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
5. WHEN the app runs THEN it SHALL execute without crashes or critical errors

### Requirement 7: Project Optimization and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and optimized project structure, so that the codebase remains maintainable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementation is complete THEN unused files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL be cleaned up if not needed
3. WHEN the project is finalized THEN it SHALL have an optimized size
4. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Flutter and Supabase best practices
5. WHEN tasks are completed THEN they SHALL be properly tracked and documented
